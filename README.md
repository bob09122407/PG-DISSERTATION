## Description

In a collaborative effort, We developed a PG dissertation management system using Spring Boot and React.js. This system enables end-to-end management of student dissertations, facilitating mentor connectivity and chat functionality via WebSocket integration with the database. Leveraging the extensive libraries and features of Spring Boot, we ensured robust and scalable performance throughout the application.
